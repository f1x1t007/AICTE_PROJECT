🔍 Overview :

This project implements image steganography, allowing users to hide secret messages inside an image without altering its visual appearance. 
The encryption process securely embeds text within an image, and only users with the correct passcode can retrieve the hidden message.

✨ Features :

✅ Secure Message Encryption – Hide secret messages in images seamlessly.
✅ Passcode Protection – Only authorized users can decrypt messages.
✅ Graphical User Interface (GUI) – User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
✅ Supports Multiple Image Formats – Works with PNG, JPEG, and JPG files.
✅ Lightweight & Fast – Efficient processing with OpenCV and NumPy.

⚙️ Technologies Used :

Python – Core programming language
OpenCV – Image processing
NumPy – Efficient numerical operations
Tkinter – GUI design for an easy-to-use interface

🖥️ How It Works?

**Encrypt a Message:

1. Open the program and select an image.

2. Enter a secret message and a passcode.

3. Click the "Encrypt Image" button.

The encrypted image will be saved automatically.

**Decrypt a Message:

1. Open the program and select an encrypted image.

2. Enter the correct passcode.

3. Click "Decrypt Image" to retrieve the hidden message.

📌 Example Output
🔐 Encryption:
Original Image → Image with Hidden Message (No Visual Change)
🔓 Decryption:
Encrypted Image + Passcode → Revealed Message

🚀 Future Enhancements :
🔹 Support for Video & Audio Steganography
🔹 Integration with AES Encryption for Dual Security
🔹 Mobile App Version for Android & iOS
🔹 Cloud-Based Steganography for Secure Online Communication
